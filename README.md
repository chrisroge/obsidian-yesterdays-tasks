# Obsidian Yesterdays Tasks Plugin
Plugin can do the following:
- Convert tasks on the currently open note from -[ ] to simple list items, use in cases where the tasks have already rolled forward to a new note, such as when a new daily note is created and other plugins have moved open tasks forward
- Convert all tasks on all [[wiki related]] notes and roll them up to the current note

## Example
this is some text this is a [[linked doc]] and in that there will be some tasks

here is a list of tasks:
- this is a task on the top level <span style="font-size: 0.5em; color: #333333">{{id-yd26yql2d}}</span>
- [x] this is a completed task on the top level
- this is another top level task <span style="font-size: 0.5em; color: #333333">{{id-fsxvhgee9}}</span>

this is [[another linked doc]]

that may or may not have other tasks or linked docs
