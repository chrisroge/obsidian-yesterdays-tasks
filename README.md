# Obsidian Yesterdays Tasks Plugin

- Convert tasks on the currently open note from -[ ] to simple list items, use in cases where the tasks have already rolled forward to a new note, such as when a new daily note is created and other plugins have moved open tasks forward
- Convert all tasks on all [[wiki related]] notes and roll them up to the current note
